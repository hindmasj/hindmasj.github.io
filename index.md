## Tumblr

I used to maintain a [tumblr site](https://open-badger.tumblr.com/). I have not posted there in a long time but there are some nice pictures. I might start to move the best bits over to here.

## Technical Posts

Some of the themes to come are on Emacs, Ansible and Docker.

I want to see how versatile this site is. Can I post external content, like from my [Flickr Account](https://www.flickr.com/photos/55891150@N00/)? We shall see.

# Testing The Working Directory

This website is build with [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages) and works by allowing you to edit in Markdown and then after you commit, GitHub uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to convert the pages to HTML.

So if you want to test the pages before you commit them you need to use Jekyll in the working directory to create the content that will actually be viewed. See [Testing The Site From Inside The Working Directory](jekyll-testing).
